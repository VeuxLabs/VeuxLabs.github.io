        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Focusing on the end-user</h3>
        <p>
            Insight into the needs, desires, and concerns of the end-user is essential to creating
            a superior product. Understanding of user priorities guides our entire design and development
            process.

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <h3>Keeping it simple</h3>
        <p>
            Our design solutions are clear and intuitive, even when an underlying workflow 
            between app and hardware is complicated. We think that being an international 
            team gives Veux Labs the broad perspective necessary for truly human-centered 
            design. We have a healthy skepticism of the latest trends, favoring a modern, 
            global, accessible aesthetic.

        <h2>App Development </h2>
        <h3> Staying agile </h3>
        <p> 
            Our engineering department ensures end products that match the intent of the original 
            design. We build apps in a series of "sprints,” adding functionality and refinement
            with each sprint. Being nimble makes us efficient and responsive to change. We have 
            expertise in native iOS, native Android, and web platforms for both consumer-focused 
            apps and enterprise systems.

            <p> 
                We love problem solving. One of our favorite challenges is making the communication 
                between apps and hardware products seem effortless. We have extensive experience 
                in uniting hardware, firmware, and app interfaces.
