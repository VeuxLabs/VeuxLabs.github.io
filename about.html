		An ancestor of the iPad is responsible for the existence of Veux Labs. 
		In 1999, Steve Brown and Karl Allen were part of the team developing Intel’s HomePad,
		a first-of-its-kind wireless tablet for consumers. As the project’s engineering leader, 
		Karl hired Steve and his firm for industrial design and product development of the HomePad.
		<br><br>
		The HomePad may have fizzled—it was perhaps a little too ahead of its time—but the creative 
		partnership was a success. In 2012, Karl and Steve decided to start their own company. 
		Veux Labs would draw upon their experience in design, app development, and hardware and 
		firmware development to create seamlessly integrated software and hardware.

		Veux Labs is a virtual business—by design. This approach keeps us nimble. We minimize 
		overhead costs so our fees are competitive. We can also handpick the team that best 
		suits a given project. Our designers and developers are dispersed across several countries, 
		giving Veux Labs global insights into consumer, design, and technology trends.
		<br><br>
		How do we make virtual work? We use time-tested management tools and technologies to 
		ensure clear communication and precise execution. We also implement the principles of 
		Lean UX and Agile to ensure coordinated design and development collaboration from start
		to finish, from approved design to final product—no shortcuts, mistranslations, or divergence.
